# Programming Assignment

## The Brief

We have a MongoDB database with 2 collections, `User` and `AssetVersion`.
We need a way to perform CRUD operations for these 2 collections remotely.

Please implement a server that will serve a CRUD API for the models defined in `models.py`.
You may use any framework/remote protocol, as long as it all starts up by running `./run`


## Requirements

- Either fork this repo or push your code to a public git repository that we can clone (GitHub, GitLab etc)
- You may use Python 2 or 3.
- Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide 
- Please add any Python dependencies to a requirements.txt
- Please include any build steps if necessary
